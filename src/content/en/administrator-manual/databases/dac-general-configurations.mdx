#### Query Sharing

<br/>Query Sharing is a feature that sends queries written in QueryPie SQL Editor to Git to share with other users. By default, query sharing settings are off, and clicking the `Query Sharing Setting` button opens a settings modal. When Query Sharing option is set to On, additional input fields are displayed.
