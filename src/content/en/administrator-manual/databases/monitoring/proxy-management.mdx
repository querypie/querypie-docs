## Overview

Administrators can use Proxy Management to view active proxy-enabled connections and check port status. When users execute queries via 3rd-party tools such as DataGrip or DBeaver, you can view and terminate those sessions as needed.

## View connections with Proxy enabled

* Proxy Session: Port information for each data source accessible via the proxy.
* Connection Name: Name of the connection for which the Use Proxy option is enabled.
* Data Source Type: Type of DBMS such as MySQL.
* Cloud Provider: Shows the cloud service provider when the connection is synchronized from the cloud.
* Session Count: Total number of sessions connected via the proxy.
* Connected At: Time when the connection was established.
* Status: Indicates whether the session is active.

1. In the Databases settings menu, go to Proxy Management.
2. You can view connections with proxy enabled and their port information by cluster.
3. You can see users connected to a connection via proxy and Kill their sessions if necessary.

## Enable the Proxy option

By default, the Use Proxy option is disabled. Enable it for connections you want to allow proxy access to.

1. In the Databases settings menu, go to DB Connections.
2. Click a registered connection.
3. Scroll down to Additional Information.
4. Check Proxy Usage to enable it.
5. Choose one of the two proxy authentication methods:
    1. Use QueryPie registered account: Generates proxy connection info using the DB username/password saved by the administrator on the connection info page. Users can connect to the proxy using an Agent or a separately generated Proxy Credential.
    2. Use existing database account with Agent: Generates proxy connection info allowing users to use their existing DB username/password. Users can connect to the proxy by running the Agent and connecting to localhost and the provided port. Note: When using the user's DB username/password, connection is only possible via the Agent.
6. Network ID: Required if you use the Reverse SSH feature.

When Proxy Usage is enabled, a port for proxy access is assigned to that connection. Once this option is enabled, users can view proxy connection information, and only administrators can configure the proxy option.
