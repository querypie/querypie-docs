# Privilege Type

### Overview

The Privilege feature allows permission control through SQL statement combinations. In addition, for web editors, you can control data export/import and clipboard copy functions. SQL statements are classified according to ANSI SQL standards, and Redis provides separate Privilege Types.

### Creating Privileges

When creating permissions, MySQL-based SET, SHOW, DESCRIBE, USE statements are basically included in all permissions.

1. Navigate to DB Access Control &gt; Privilege Type menu from the Database settings menu.
2. Click the `Create Privilege Type` button in the top right.
3. Enter the following information for policy creation:
    1.  **Name**  : Name that can distinguish the permission on screen.
    2.  **Database Type**  : Select the type of database to which the permission is granted. Basically select General type.
    3.  **Privilege Type**  : Select the statements to allow execution with this permission. 
    4.  **Functions**  : Select the operations allowed with this permission. You can control data export/import and clipboard copy functions within web editors.

You can check that the permission has been created in the Privilege Type list.

**How can I create and manage access permissions for Redis connections?**

When selecting Database Type as Redis in the Privilege creation screen, you can create Privileges with separate Redis-specific permission types.

* Permissions allowed for execution when accessing Redis are largely classified into Read, Write, Dangerous, Etc. 
* Read, Write, Dangerous, Etc. categories refer to [Redis ACL Categories](https://redis.io/commands/) standards.
* Among selected categories, you can restrict by setting commands to restrict execution in Restrict Commands.
