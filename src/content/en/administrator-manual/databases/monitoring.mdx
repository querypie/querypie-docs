# Monitoring

### Overview

In QueryPie, query execution has three paths.

* Users input queries and execute them using Web Editor.
* Using SQL Request in Workflow, after going through approval, the Executor presses the execute button to execute when approval is complete.
* Execute through QueryPie Proxy using 3rd party tools (such as DBeaver) (user agent method) or using URLs (agent-less).

Queries executed as above can be monitored through Running Queries and Proxy Management, and administrators can force stop them if necessary. (Available from 10.3.0 onwards)

<Callout type="info">
From 10.3.0, the query force stop feature has been added to the Running Queries feature that was previously only available for monitoring under Audit. Proxy Management had session force functionality from before and has only been moved to under Monitoring.
