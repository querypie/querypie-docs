## Choose an authentication method

Starting from QueryPie 10.2.4, you can choose the Google Cloud authentication method for BigQuery connections. The default authentication method used in Google Cloud synchronization is Service Account key authentication, so newly synchronized or manually created connections use Service Account key authentication by default. Additionally, for both manually created connections and those synchronized from the cloud, you can change the authentication method from Service Account key to OAuth 2.0 and save it. To use OAuth 2.0 authentication, you must first register the Client ID and Client Secret from the Google Cloud API Console in QueryPie.

## Google Cloud API Integration

For how to set up Google Cloud API Integration, please refer to: [Integrating Google Cloud API for OAuth 2.0](../../../general/system/integrations/integrating-google-cloud-api-for-oauth-20)

## Specify an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for a connection

Whether the connection was created via cloud synchronization or manually, you can select "Using Google User Account (OAuth 2.0)" as the Authentication Method.
