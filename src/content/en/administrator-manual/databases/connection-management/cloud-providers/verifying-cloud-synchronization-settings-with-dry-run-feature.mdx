title: 'Verifying Cloud Synchronization Settings with Dry Run Feature'
---

## Overview

What is Cloud Synchronization Dry Run? <br/>It serves to test and verify the cloud synchronization process, allowing you to check in advance what the synchronization results will be. <br/>When changing existing integration information, unexpected results may occur due to user input errors. To prevent such problems in advance, users can change existing information and then perform a "Dry Run" to test the entered content in advance.<br/>

## Performing Dry Run

1. Select a specific cloud item from the list in Databases &gt; [Connection Management] &gt; Cloud Provider.
2. Change the setting items you want to change on the detail page, then click the `Dry Run` button in the top right.
