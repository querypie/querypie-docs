## Overview

All activities within QueryPie are recorded in audit logs. User and administrator login/logout, permission grants and revocations, access to databases, servers, and Kubernetes, query or command execution, resource or security configuration changes, and all activity history occurring in QueryPie and access-controlled resources are subject to logging.

## Available Features

* **Audit Log Export**: Audit logs can be extracted and saved as files through the **Audit Log Export** menu.
* **Report Generation**: QueryPie data status can be output in report format through the **Report** menu.
* **Audit Log Viewing**: Real-time log viewing, searching, and filtering are available through **individual log pages** under the Audit menu.

## Types of Auditable Logs

1. Logs stored in real-time can be checked in the list within individual log pages. (Sorted by latest first)
2. Logs can be searched or filtered by specific column values.
3. Clicking on a specific log in the list allows you to check detailed information in a Drawer.

The types of auditable logs vary depending on the license you have, and the types of logs provided by license are as follows:
