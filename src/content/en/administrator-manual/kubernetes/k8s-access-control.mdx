# K8s Access Control

### Overview

You can easily and conveniently grant or revoke access permissions to Kubernetes APIs to users or groups based on roles. You can define detailed policies for each Kubernetes cluster, such as which users are allowed or restricted to make which API calls to which resources in which environment, and set up access to Kubernetes resources with minimal permissions according to roles suitable for business purposes for users or groups. When a user belongs to multiple user groups or multiple policies and permissions are granted in duplicate, policies are applied in a nested manner. For other permissions, it operates based on All Deny.
