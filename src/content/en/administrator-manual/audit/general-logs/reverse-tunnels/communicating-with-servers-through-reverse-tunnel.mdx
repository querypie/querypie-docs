# Communicating with Servers through Reverse Tunnel

### Communicating with Servers through Reverse Tunnel

QueryPie supports Reverse Tunneling as a means to communicate with resources in different Network Zones. When you install a Reverse Tunnel Agent in the Network Zone you want to access, the Reverse Tunnel Agent establishes a connection toward QueryPie (Outbound).

You can communicate from QueryPie to resources in different Network Zones through Reverse Tunnels by adding Tags to resources (servers).

1. Navigate to Administrator &gt; Servers &gt; Connection Management &gt; Servers menu.
2. Select a server from the list. For new server registration, please refer to [Manually Registering Individual Servers](../../../servers/connection-management/servers/manually-registering-individual-servers).
3. Add the following Tag to the Tags section in the Server List Detail page.
    1. `RTS = TRUE` : Servers with this Tag will attempt to connect through Reverse Tunnels.
    2. Reverse Tunnel Agent Tag : Connects to the server through a Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag. If there is no Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag, connection will fail.
4. Click the `Save Changes` button to save the settings.
