## Communicating with DB through Reverse Tunnel

QueryPie supports Reverse Tunneling as a means to communicate with resources in different Network Zones. When you install a Reverse Tunnel Agent in the Network Zone you want to access, the Reverse Tunnel Agent establishes a connection toward QueryPie (Outbound).

You can communicate from QueryPie to resources in different Network Zones through Reverse Tunnels by adding Tags to resources (DB Connection).

1. Navigate to Administrator &gt; Databases &gt; Connection Management &gt; DB Connections menu.
2. Select a DB Connection from the list. For new DB registration, please refer to [Manually Registering DB Connections](../../../databases/connection-management/db-connections).
3. Add the following Tag to the Tags section in the DB Connection List Detail page.
    1. `RTS = TRUE` : DB Connections with this Tag will attempt to connect through Reverse Tunnels.
    2. Reverse Tunnel Agent Tag : Connects to the DB through a Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag. If there is no Reverse Tunnel Agent with the same Tag, connection will fail.
4. Click the `Save Changes` button to save the settings.
