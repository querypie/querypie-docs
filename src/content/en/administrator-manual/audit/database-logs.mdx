# Database Logs

### Overview

You can view logs generated from QueryPie's Database Access Control in Database Logs. You can check information such as DB access permission grants and revocations, DB access history, executed queries, and DML query snapshots. Additionally, you can view and release connection lock history due to DB connection password failures and long-term inactivity through QueryPie.
