# Enable Server Proxy

### Overview

A proxy connection is supported for server access. By default, you can connect to servers via the web Terminal provided by QueryPie, and with the QueryPie Agent you can also connect from your existing tools that use OS account/password. With proxy connections alongside the web Terminal, you can control server access, apply policies, and retain logs reliably across diverse user environments. Currently supported proxy clients include (Mac) iTerm2, Terminal, and (Windows) Windows Console Host, Windows Terminal, and PuTTY.

### Enable the Proxy option

To allow server access through the proxy, you must first create a policy with Proxy Usage enabled. For how to create a policy and enable Proxy Usage, refer to the document below.
