## Overview

When the number of connection failures for a server account granted to a user reaches the failure threshold set by the administrator within the configured time, QueryPie deactivates the user's server account within the system. This does not deactivate the actual server account and does not affect other users using the same server account. We provide administrators with a menu to manage deactivated server accounts, where they can activate server accounts.

## Activating Server Accounts
