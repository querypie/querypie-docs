## Overview

You can manage command templates that cannot be used after accessing servers managed by the organization. Once set, command templates can be reused when setting access permissions. Command blocking is based on strings, and command blocking through regular expressions is also supported. Additionally, you can standardize the list of commands that users can select in the server privilege request process to improve management efficiency.
