1. **[Step 1]** Finally confirm all accounts selected to ensure no accounts were incorrectly granted. If you want to make changes, you can click the `Previous` button to go back to the previous step. 
2. Each policy item is as follows:
    1.  **`{n}` Server(s) selected**  : This item displays the number of Servers selected in **[Step 1]** x the number of Accounts. Click to view each item in list format.
    2.  **Set Permissions by Minute**  : When this option is selected, server access permissions can be set in minutes. When the checkbox is selected, the following setting items are activated.
        1. Start Trigger : Select the permission grant start condition
            1. Access to the Server : Permissions are activated immediately when the user accesses the server. Regardless of server session maintenance, server access is possible for the specified period from the activation time. 
            2. Grant : The timer starts immediately upon permission grant, and permissions are valid only for the specified period regardless of the user's actual access.
        2.  **Duration(Minutes)** : Enter the valid time in minutes for the permission.
    3.  **Expiration Date**  : Set the access permission expiration date. Can be set up to a maximum of 1 year. (Default = 1 year later)

        2.  **Whitelist Expiration Date**  : Specify a separate exception handling expiration date for the above commands.
    7.  **Require Privilege** : When this option is activated, users must go through an approval process through Server Privilege Request workflow to access servers with that account. This is useful when temporarily allowing and managing access to high-privilege accounts such as administrator (Admin) accounts on Windows servers.
        * When attempting to access with an account where this option is activated, the `Connect` button is disabled when accessing the server from the user dashboard, and a message is displayed indicating that an access permission request must be submitted.
        * The Require Privilege option can be applied to all accounts regardless of the server's OS type.
    8.  **Access Start Time**  : Set the allowed access start time.
