## Overview

You can grant Server Privilege to servers with access permissions through Permission or Role to temporarily allow the use of specific commands. When granting Server Privilege again to a target that already has Server Privilege, the existing Server Privilege is revoked and newly granted again.

**Q. Is there a place where I can check the history of granted or revoked permissions?**

A. When the target server for setting Server Privilege is granted through Permission, <br/>it is recorded in Audit menu &gt; Servers &gt; Access Control Logs.
