# SAC General Configurations

<Callout type="info">
Starting from version 10.3.0, SAC-related configuration items that were previously under Administrator &gt; General &gt; Security have been moved to General &gt; Configurations under each service menu.
</Callout>

### Overview

The Configurations page is a settings page in QueryPie where you can manage server access and security policies. You can configure core elements of server connection security such as login failure threshold settings, session timeouts, and insecure protocol controls. This allows administrators to configure server environments according to their organization's security requirements and protect systems from potential threats.

### Server Connection Security Settings

Manage security settings applied to server access control.

#### General Settings

Manage basic security settings.

*  **Permission Revocation Period :** Automatic revocation of server permissions for long-term inactive users
    * When Enable is selected, server access permissions granted to users are automatically revoked if they do not access the server for the specified period (days). 
    * Important Notes
        * This only applies to Direct Permissions or Role permissions with expiration dates that are directly granted to users.
        * Permissions inherited from groups or permanent permissions without specified expiration dates are not affected by this feature.
        * If a user has never accessed the server after being granted permission, the period is calculated from the time the permission was granted.
*  **Maximum OS Account Login Failures before Lockout** : Account lockout policy for login failures
    * Specify the maximum number of server login failures allowed
    * When Enable is selected, additional input is possible based on count and time range criteria (e.g., account lockout after 2 failures within 11 minutes)
*  **Maximum Command Attempts before Session Termination** : Maximum execution count for prohibited commands
    * When Enable is selected, additional input is possible based on count and time range criteria (e.g., session termination after 10 attempts within 10 minutes)
*  **Retain Session After Policy Change** : Setting for maintaining connected sessions when server access policies are changed
    *  **Enable**  selection:
        * Active sessions are maintained and not terminated even in the following cases:
            * Direct permission grant or revocation
            * Policy updates
            * User role changes
        * However, sessions for related resources are terminated if the user's role or permissions are completely removed
        * Session reconnection is required to apply changed policies
    *  **Disable**  selection:
        * All connected sessions are automatically terminated when policies are changed
        * Changed policies are applied to newly connected sessions
*  **Server Session Timeout**  : Server session timeout criteria (minutes)
    * Timeout when no commands are executed after server access for the specified time
    * This setting applies when no timeout is specified in individual policies
    * If timeout policies are specified in individual policies or Server Default Settings, the shorter one is applied
*  **Using insecure protocols** : Setting for using server access protocols that are not recommended
    * Set whether to use TELNET or FTP
*  **Access Server with MFA**  : MFA authentication when accessing servers (Default : Disabled)
    * Currently supports Google OTP, and when this option is selected, servers to apply MFA authentication are specified by tag criteria
        * Tag input method: key input → Enter key input → value input → Enter input
    * Input tags are displayed in `key = value` format, and servers with at least one tag matching the input tags can be accessed after MFA authentication
*  **Resource IP Access Control Configuration :** Server access allowed IP access control settings
    * Specify servers to apply IP access control by tag criteria
    * Applied with priority over Roles or Direct Permissions granted to Users/Groups
    * When the `Add Configuration` button is clicked, a modal is created and the following information is entered to click the `Add` button (not reflected until the `Save Changes` button in the top right is clicked)
        *  **Server Tag Key**  : Enter the server tag key, only one can be applied at a time (required when used)
        *  **Server Tag Value**  : Enter the server tag value, only one can be applied at a time (required when used)
        *  **Allowed Zones**  : Loads the list from General &gt; Company Management &gt; Allowed Zones, minimum 1 selection required when used
    * When this feature is activated, the IP ranges of Allowed Zones set here are displayed when users access servers.

<Callout type="info">
**Important Notes**
Allowed Zones represent broad ranges of allowed IP addresses. Therefore, even if you are within the displayed IP range, final access may be denied if administrators have set additional IP restrictions through data policies (DP/Policy), etc.
</Callout>

*  **Password Provisioning :** Setting for using password provisioning
    * Periodically change passwords for server accounts of registered servers
    * When set to On, the following changes occur:
        * Account selection options for password provisioning are added in [Managing Servers as Groups | 3.-Registering-Accounts](connection-management/server-groups/managing-servers-as-groups#3.-accounts-%eb%93%b1%eb%a1%9d%ed%95%98%ea%b8%b0)
        * [Password Provisioning](server-account-management/password-provisioning) menu is activated and Password change Jobs can be registered
        * [Account Management](server-account-management/account-management) menu is activated and provides account list lookup functionality for servers managed by QueryPie
*  **Allow RDP Connection without Server Agent :**  Setting for allowing access to Windows Servers without RDP Server Agent installed
    * Access Windows Servers via RDP protocol through QueryPie

<Callout type="important">
When accessing Windows Servers without RDP Server Agent installed, the following limitations apply:
* Server accounts used for server access cannot be controlled.
* Only Server Access History is recorded, and the server account used for Windows access is not recorded.
* Command Audit and Session Recording are not recorded.
* It is recommended to use this only for the purpose of installing RDP Server Agent, and Audit and recording work normally from the point when remote connection is restarted after RDP Server Agent installation.
</Callout>

*  **Using One Time Accounts**  : Setting for using temporary login accounts
    * Sets whether to use the feature that creates unique temporary accounts for each server session.
    * When Enable is selected, it works as follows:
        * QueryPie - One Time Account is added as an Account category in Server Groups menu settings.
        * Provisioning accounts and One Time Accounts can be registered in the system.
        * When accessing servers, the system automatically creates temporary accounts on the server.

#### Default Policy Settings for Server Permission Requests

Manage server access policies applied when assigning Direct Permissions through Workflow requests.

Policy content is reflected based on the **Workflow request creation time**. Even if access policies are changed after the request is approved, they are not retroactively applied to previously approved requests.
</Callout>
