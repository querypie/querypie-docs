# Creating Password Change Jobs

### Overview

Register Jobs that periodically change passwords for access accounts of servers registered in QueryPie. Jobs are created by server group unit, and password changes perform account-specific provisioning for individual servers belonging to the server group.

<Callout type="info">
To change server account passwords through QueryPie, you need to register accounts with password change permissions on each server. Also, to change account passwords for multiple servers through one Job, you need to create server accounts to be used in the Job with the same account name and password on each server.
