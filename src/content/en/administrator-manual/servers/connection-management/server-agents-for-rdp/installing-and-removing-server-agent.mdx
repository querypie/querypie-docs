* Access the Server Agent download page.
    * You can access the Server Agent download page by adding `/for-agent/server-agent/download` after the installed QueryPie domain address.<br/>e.g. `https://sac.querypie.io/for-agent/server-agent/download`

<Callout type="info">
In 11.3.0, administrators can also download server agents through the UI (the `Download Server Agent` button on the Admin &gt; Servers &gt; Connection Management &gt; RDP Server Agent page). You can still download using the existing download link page. (Use this when non-QueryPie users need to download agents externally)

* Login to QueryPie is required for agent installation.
* Click the Windows button in the center of the screen to download the compressed file.
* Extract the compressed file on the Windows server to be installed. The compressed file contains the following two files.
    1. QueryPie Server Access Control_(QueryPie Version)_Setup
    2. CONFIG
* Place both files in the same path, then run the QueryPie Server Access Control_(QueryPie Version)_Setup file.
* Install the file according to the instructions.

<Callout type="info">
**CONFIG File Description**

Contains the address of QueryPie to which the RDP Server Agent will connect.

Starting from version 10.2.8, you can specify the Port to use for RDP connection in the CONFIG file.
</Callout>

<Callout type="important">
**Changing Port Used for RDP Connection**
* Port changes for RDP are not supported in QueryPie Web.
* If port changes are needed, you must reinstall the RDP Server Agent.
</Callout>


### Installing Server Agent Without CONFIG File

Installing without GUI allows automatic program installation without user intervention, which is useful for large-scale deployment or remote installation.

You can automatically install Server Agent through PowerShell or CMD.

**PowerShell**
```
& "{installation file path}.exe" /Url="{QueryPie web address}" /Port="{Port to use for RDP}" /VERYSILENT
```

e.g.
```
& ".\QueryPie_Server_Access_Control_Setup.exe" /Url="https://dev.querypie.com" /Port="13389" /VERYSILENT
```


**CMD**
```
"{installation file path}.exe" /Url="{QueryPie web address}" /Port="{Port to use for RDP}" /VERYSILENT
```

e.g.

After moving to the Server Agent installation file location in CMD, execute the following command
```
".\QueryPie_Server_Access_Control_Setup.exe" /Url="https://dev.querypie.com"  /Port="13389" /VERYSILENT
```
