# Managing Servers as Groups

### Overview

You can group numerous servers and apply accessible accounts and policies at once. You can create server groups according to purpose and conveniently manage policies in bulk, and grant grouped server group permissions to individual users or user groups at once.

<Callout type="info">
We recommend registering each resource required for server group registration in advance.

</figure>


1. Navigate to Administrator &gt; Servers &gt; Connection Management &gt; Server Groups menu.
2. Click the `+ Create Group` button in the top right. 
3. Enter the following information for group creation. 
    1.  **Name** : Name that can distinguish the server group on the screen. 
    2.  **Description** : You can enter additional descriptions of the server group. If there are multiple administrators, we recommend entering detailed names and descriptions according to purpose for easy identification between server groups. 
    3.  **Server Tags** : You can dynamically manage server group targets by specifying tags of servers to be grouped through Server Tags.
4. Save through the `Save` button. 

<Callout type="info">
Server groups can manage servers based on Tags. By specifying specific Tags in the Server Tags of server groups, flexible server management is possible where all servers with those Tags are included in the server group.
</Callout>


### Creating/Modifying Server Groups

You can create server groups by entering the information below. Some items can be modified after creation.

#### 1. Entering Basic Information and Adding Servers by Tag

<figure data-layout="center" data-align="center">
![image-20240902-045749.png](/administrator-manual/servers/connection-management/server-groups/managing-servers-as-groups/image-20240902-045749.png)
</figure>

* Name : Enter the name of the server group. 
* Description : Enter content that can describe the server group. If there are multiple administrators, we recommend entering detailed names and descriptions according to purpose for easy identification between server groups. 
* Server Tags : You can dynamically manage server group targets by specifying tags of servers to be grouped. Servers added through tags cannot be manually deleted from the server table and must be modified by modifying the tags in Server Tags. 

#### 2. Manually Adding Servers

<figure data-layout="center" data-align="center">

</figure>

* In Servers, you can check servers that belong to the server group or manually add servers to the server group. 
    * Clicking the `Add Server` button in the top right displays a popup showing the server list above the screen.
    * In the popup window, select individual servers to add to the server group and click the `Add` button.
        * You can filter servers with various conditions using the filter(:filter:) function in the popup.
        * You can check the servers finally added to the server group.
* Even if you delete tags related to manually added servers in the Server Tags of Information, manually added servers are not excluded from the server group. Only manual deletion through the `Delete` button that appears after selecting the checkbox in the Servers table is possible.
* You can check account information for Servers and Accounts added to the Server Group through Test Connection.
    * To use Test Connection, you must add at least 1 Server and Account to the Server Group. 

<Callout type="info">
Test Connection can only be used after saving the Server Group.
</Callout>

    2.  **Provisioning and One Time Account** 
        1. Category items are visible only when Password Provisioning and Using One Time Accounts are activated in Admin &gt; Servers &gt; Configures. 
        2. `QueryPie - Provisioning` : Uses accounts registered in QueryPie for Provisioning purposes.
            * Required items : Account
            * When Admin &gt; Servers &gt; Configurations &gt; Using One Time Accounts is activated, Set As Provisioning Account checkbox can be checked

    3.  **Secret Store Integration (Hashicorp Vault)** 
        1. Category items are visible only when Admin &gt; General &gt; Security &gt; Secret Stores is activated.

                * Secret Store : Only items with K/V engine type are filtered and displayed. 
            * When utilizing Secret Store integration information when registering Account information in server groups, you can access connections through pre-designated Secret Store authentication information integration. By pre-storing server authentication information in Secret Store and having users utilize server authentication information stored in Secret Store when accessing servers remotely, security for server authentication information can be enhanced. Servers designated for Server Groups are forced to use the same Secret Store as Server Groups.
            * Enter the server account name to be exposed to users in the Alias field.
        3. `Vault - K/V - SSH Key` **** : Uses SSH Keys stored in Vault K/V engine.

            * You can manage server accounts in Passwordless form using Hashicorp Vault's SSH OTP engine. However, you must install vault-ssh-helper, which is Vault's server agent, on the server. For detailed guide, please refer to [Hashicorp Vault Official Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/ssh-otp).
        5. `Vault - SSH - CA` **** : Uses Vault's SSH CA engine.
            * Required items: Account, Secret Store, Vault Role Path
                * Secret Store : Only items with CA engine type are filtered and displayed. 
            * You can manage server accounts in Passwordless form using Hashicorp Vault's SSH CA engine (Signed SSH certificates). However, you must add the Public Key issued by the vault ca engine to the TrustedUserCAKeys of the server to be accessed. For detailed guide, please refer to [Hashicorp Vault Official Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates).

<Callout type="info">
**Common Item: Account**
* Enter a name that can distinguish individual accounts. 
    1. When entering `{username}`, it is replaced with QueryPie's username when users with permissions access the server through QueryPie.
    2. When username is in email format, entering `{username_prefix}` replaces it with the prefix part of QueryPie's username (part before @).

<Callout type="info">
Provisioning accounts must be accounts actually registered on the server and require the following settings.
* Account creation/deletion permissions are required.
* Must be set to not enter password when using sudo.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Due to macOS VNC protocol limitations, automatic login through VNC is blocked.
