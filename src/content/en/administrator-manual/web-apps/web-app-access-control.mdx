# Web App Access Control

### Overview

This document provides a guide for effectively managing web app access permissions in QueryPie. It provides methods to repeatedly grant pre-defined access permissions through RBAC, and manages access to only allowed web applications for each user through URL-based web app access control. Additionally, you can set detailed access rules through policy management functionality.
