# [10.2.8~] WAC RBAC Guide

QueryPie WAC provides RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

This document provides guidance on WAC roles and policies applied to version `10.2.8` and above.

## WAC Roles and Policies

* Policy is a specification that describes how to control access to resources registered in WAC, written in YAML format.
    * It includes allowing or blocking web app resources.
* Role is an object that defines what users can and cannot do.
    * Multiple policies can be assigned to one role, and in this case, policies are combined with OR conditions.
    * When multiple policies exist for the same Web App and sub-paths, Deny policies take precedence over Allow policies.
* Users can be assigned multiple roles but can only select and use one at a time.

<Callout type="important">
**Warning**
When all policies included in a role are combined, **at least 1 allow policy** must remain.<br/>Roles composed only of deny policies do not grant any app permissions and cannot be used normally.
</Callout>

## Basic Structure of WAC YAML Policy

WAC policies are written in YAML format, and their basic structure is as follows.

### YAML Document Example

```
apiVersion: webApp.rbac.querypie.com/v1
kind: WacPolicy

spec:
  allow:
    resources:
      - webApp: "Querypie Web Admin"
        urlPathTags:              
          access: "admin"
      - webApp: "QueryPie Customer Portal"
        urlPaths: ["*"]          
    conditions:
      userAttributes:
        department: "White"
      ipAddresses: 
        - "10.10.0.0/24"
        - "10.10.1.79"
  deny:
    resources:
      - webApp: "Querypie Web Admin"
        urlPaths: 
          - "/general-settings/user-management/roles"
```

Below is the QueryPie WAC Policy YAML syntax needed for policy writing.

### spec: &lt;effect&gt;**[required]**

Specifies whether to allow or deny specific rules of the policy. Supports `spec: allow` or `spec: deny`.

1. A policy can have a maximum of 1 `allow` and 1 `deny`.
2. When `deny` and `allow` are declared simultaneously for the same element within a policy, `deny` takes precedence.

### Resources**[required]**

Specifies the web app resources for which you want to set allow or block policies. Must have `webApp` as a required sub-element and can have `urlPaths` or `urlPathTags`.

<Callout type="info">
`resources` is allowed in both `spec: allow` and `spec: deny`.
However, specification through `urlPathTags` is only supported in `spec: allow`.
</Callout>

#### webApp**[required]**

Enter the web app resource name defined in QueryPie.

1. Web apps must be specified explicitly, and wildcards or regular expressions are not allowed.
    * `- webApp: "QueryPie"` (O)
    * `- webApp: "*Query*"` (X)
    * `- webApp: "QueryPie$"` (X)
2. Multiple web apps can be listed within one `spec`.
3. Web app names must meet the following conditions.
    * Maximum 120 characters
    * Only alphabetic case-sensitive letters, numbers, and some special symbols (`_`, `-`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`) are allowed
    * Spaces are allowed
    * Start and end are limited to alphabetic case-sensitive letters or numbers
    * No duplicates allowed

To operate access control policies at the sub-path level of web apps, you can enter `urlPaths` or `urlPathTags` under `webApp`. Within one policy, it is **impossible** to specify both `urlPaths` and `urlPathTags` for the same web app.

#### urlPaths**[OPTIONAL]**

Specifies the sub-paths of specific web app resources to which you want to apply policies.

1. Only sub-paths registered in Admin &gt; Web App can be registered.
2. To allow or deny **all** sub-paths that exist in the web app, including Base URL, write `urlPaths: ["*"]`.
    * Example: Block access to all paths of QueryPie Web Admin
3. When entering sub-paths, policies are applied to the entered paths.
    * Sub-paths are listed and multiple can be entered.
    * You can enter wildcards at the end of paths to indicate all paths under specific paths. (Does not include parent paths)
    * Overlapping paths cannot be entered simultaneously.
        * Example: **Cannot enter simultaneously** `/general-settings/*` and `/general-settings/user-management` of QueryPie Web Admin 
4. Wildcards cannot be entered in the middle of paths or as part of path names, and regular expressions cannot be entered.
    * `"/*-settings"` (X)
    * `"/*/edit"` (X)
    * `"^/database-settings/policies/data-.*$"` (X)
5. When deny and allow policies overlap for the same resource (and sub-paths), **deny policies are applied first**.

#### urlPathTags**[OPTIONAL]**

Specifies sub-paths to allow access based on URL Path tags assigned to each sub-path registered in the web app.

1. Tags are case-sensitive and multiple can be entered.
    * When multiple tags with the same Key are entered, they operate with **OR** conditions.
        * Example: Allow access to paths with `access: admin` or `access: user` tags
    * When multiple tags with different Keys are entered, they operate with **AND** conditions.
        * Example: Allow access to paths with both `access: admin` and `type: general` tags

### Conditions**[OPTIONAL]**

`conditions` defines conditions to narrow the scope of resources to which rules apply. Two types of condition specifications are possible: `userAttributes` and `ipAddresses`.

<Callout type="info">
`conditions` is only syntactically allowed in spec:allow.
</Callout>

#### userAttributes**[OPTIONAL]**

Limits the scope of users whose resource access is allowed by rules based on QueryPie user attributes.

<Callout type="info">
User attributes can be viewed in the user detail page in Administrator &gt; General &gt; Users menu. Attributes of users added in QueryPie can be added/changed/deleted in the detail page, and attributes of users added through IdP synchronization can be changed in the user registry (Okta, LDAP, etc.).
</Callout>

Attribute information is case-sensitive and multiple can be entered.

* When multiple attributes with the same Key are entered, they operate with OR conditions.
    * Example: Allow access for users whose department is PM or QA
* When multiple attributes with different Keys are entered, they operate with AND conditions.
    * Example: Allow access for users whose department is PM and title is manager

#### ipAddresses**[OPTIONAL]**

Defines a list of IP access control conditions for resources in single IP, CIDR format.
```
ipAddresses: ["10.10.0.0/24", "10.11.10.1"]
```

If not defined separately, the default value is allow all (`0.0.0.0/0`).

## Recommended Operation Methods

We recommend specifying web apps and sub-paths to allow access by permission.

1. Check the permission list that exists for each web app. 
    1. Example: For a recruitment platform,
        1. HR - has all permissions
        2. Interviewer - can only access pages that manage interview results
2. Create Roles for each permission of the web app.
    1. HR, Interviewer
3. Create access policies for each permission and assign them to Roles.
    1. HR - Allow access to all paths within the recruitment platform
    2. Interviewer - Allow access only to interview result pages within the recruitment platform

<Callout type="important">
**Warning**

When using partial allow patterns, **landing pages that are absolutely necessary for normal website use** must be configured as separate policies and included in roles.

* Example: Login pages, redirect pages, etc.
</Callout>


Choose one of the following two methods for specifying sub-paths to allow access.

#### Tag-based Access Control

We recommend registering Paths in web apps, assigning appropriate tags to each Path, and then controlling access based on tags in policies. Using this method provides the following benefits:

*  **Easy role-based policy management** : Manage by assigning the same tags to paths needed for specific roles
*  **Simplified policy maintenance** : Even when new paths are added to web apps, access control is possible without modifying existing policies by just assigning appropriate tags
*  **Complex access control implementation** : Implement detailed access control by combining various conditions (user attributes, IP addresses, etc.) with tags

#### Wildcard Utilization

You can efficiently control access to all pages under specific paths using the newly supported wildcard functionality.

* Overall access control for admin pages: `/admin/*`
* Overall access control for specific feature modules: `/module/orders/*`
