# [~10.2.7] WAC Role & Policy Guide

QueryPie WAC provides RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) like other QueryPie products.

This document provides guidance on WAC roles and policies applied to version `10.2.7` and below.

## WAC Roles and Policies

* Policy is a specification that describes how to control access to resources registered in WAC, written in YAML format.
    * It includes allowing or blocking web app resources.
* Role is an object that defines what users can and cannot do.
    * Multiple policies can be assigned to one role, and in this case, policies are combined with OR conditions.
    * When multiple policies exist for the same Web App and sub-paths, Deny policies take precedence over Allow policies.
* Users can be assigned multiple roles but can only select and use one at a time.

<Callout type="important">
**Warning**
When all policies included in a role are combined, **at least 1 allow policy** must remain.<br/>Roles composed only of deny policies do not grant any app permissions and cannot be used normally.
</Callout>

## Basic Structure of WAC YAML Policy

WAC policies are written in YAML format, and their basic structure is as follows.

Below is the QueryPie WAC Policy YAML syntax needed for policy writing.

### spec: &lt;effect&gt;**[required]**

Specifies whether to allow or deny specific rules of the policy. Supports `spec: allow` or `spec: deny`.

1. A policy can have a maximum of 1 `allow` and 1 `deny`.
2. When `deny` and `allow` are declared simultaneously for the same element within a policy, `deny` takes precedence.

### Resources**[required]**

Specifies the web app resources for which you want to set allow or block policies. Must have `webApp` and `urlPaths` as sub-elements.

<Callout type="info">
`resources` is allowed in both `spec: allow` and `spec: deny`.
</Callout>

#### webApp**[required]**

Enter the web app resource name defined in QueryPie.

1. Web apps must be specified explicitly, and wildcards or regular expressions are not allowed. 
    * `- webApp: "QueryPie"` (O)
    * `- webApp: "*Query*"` (X)
    * `- webApp: "QueryPie$"` (X)
2. Multiple web apps can be listed within one `spec`.
3. Web app names must meet the following conditions.
    * Maximum 120 characters
    * Only alphabetic case-sensitive letters, numbers, and some special symbols (`_`, `-`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`) are allowed
    * Spaces are allowed
    * Start and end are limited to alphabetic case-sensitive letters or numbers
    * No duplicates allowed

#### urlPaths**[OPTIONAL]**

Specifies the sub-paths of specific web app resources to which you want to apply policies.

1. Only sub-paths registered in Admin &gt; Web App can be registered. 
2. To allow or deny **all** sub-paths that exist in the web app, including Base URL, use the following methods.
    * Do not write the urlPaths row.
        * Example: Allow access to all paths of QueryPie Web Admin
    * Write `urlPaths: []`.
        * Example: Block access to all paths of QueryPie Web Admin
3. When entering specific sub-paths, policies are applied to the entered paths and all their sub-paths.
    * Sub-paths are listed and multiple can be entered.
        * Example: Allow access to `/general-settings/user-management` and `/general-settings/user-management/*`, and `/kubernetes-settings` and `/kubernetes-settings/*` of QueryPie Web Admin
    * Parent paths and their included detailed paths cannot be entered simultaneously.
        * Example: **Cannot enter simultaneously** `/general-settings` and `/general-settings/user-management` of QueryPie Web Admin 

<Callout type="info">
To enter specific sub-paths in urlPaths, Path Management activation is required in Web App details. An error occurs when entering unregistered sub-paths.
</Callout>

1. Wildcards or regular expressions are not supported. 
    * `"/*-settings"` (X)
    * `"^/database-settings/policies/data-.*$"` (X)
2. When deny and allow policies overlap for the same resource (and sub-paths), **deny policies take precedence**.

### Conditions**[OPTIONAL]**

`conditions` defines conditions to narrow the scope of resources to which rules apply. Three types of condition specifications are possible: `urlPathTags`, `userAttributes`, and `ipAddresses`.

<Callout type="info">
`conditions` is only syntactically allowed in spec:allow.
</Callout>

#### urlPathTags**[OPTIONAL]**

Limits the scope of resources whose access is allowed by rules based on tags assigned to Web App's Path Management.

1. Tags are case-sensitive and multiple can be entered.
    * When multiple tags with the same Key are entered, they operate with OR conditions. 
        * Example: Allow access to paths with `access: admin` or `access: user` tags
    * When multiple tags with different Keys are entered, they operate with AND conditions. 
        * Example: Allow access to paths with both `access: admin` and `type: general` tags
2. Operates in conjunction with `resources[].urlPaths`.
    *  **When target urlPath of web app resource is not specified** 
        * Allows all paths with urlPathTag among all registered sub-paths.
        * Example: For Web App "QueryPie Web Admin", allow access only to paths with `access: admin` tags among all sub-paths registered in Path Management
    *  **When target urlPath of web app resource is specified** 
        * Allows only paths with urlPathTag among specified paths.
        * Example: For Web App "QueryPie Web Admin", among the two paths specified in `resources[].urlPaths`, allow access only to paths with `access: admin` tags in Path Management
    *  **When target urlPath of web app resource is specified but no matching urlPathTag exists within the scope** 
        * No paths match the conditions, so no paths are allowed.

#### userAttributes**[OPTIONAL]**

Limits the scope of users whose resource access is allowed by rules based on QueryPie user attributes.

<Callout type="info">
User attributes can be viewed in the user detail page in Administrator &gt; General &gt; Users menu. Attributes of users added in QueryPie can be added/changed/deleted in the detail page, and attributes of users added through IdP synchronization can be changed in the user registry (Okta, LDAP, etc.).
</Callout>

Attribute information is case-sensitive and multiple can be entered.

* When multiple attributes with the same Key are entered, they operate with OR conditions. 
    * Example: Allow access for users whose department is PM or QA
* When multiple attributes with different Keys are entered, they operate with AND conditions. 
    * Example: Allow access for users whose department is PM and title is manager

#### ipAddresses**[OPTIONAL]**

Defines a list of IP access control conditions for resources in single IP, CIDR format.
```
ipAddresses: ["10.10.0.0/24", "10.11.10.1"]
```

If not defined separately, the default value is allow all (`0.0.0.0/0`).

## Recommended Usage Methods

### Full Allow + Partial Deny

The most basic usage is to create separate full allow policies and purpose-specific deny policies and assign them to one role.

For example, configure policies as follows.

1. All Allow policy (access to all sub-links including service and management console)
2. Service A Console Deny policy (e.g., block access to management console A)
3. Service B Console Deny policy (e.g., block access to management console B)

And combine policies by role.

1. General user role
    1. Policy 1 + 2 + 3 = access only to service
2. Service A administrator role
    1. Policy 1 + 3 = access only to service and management console A
3. Service B administrator role
    1. Policy 1 + 2 = access only to service and management console B

This pattern can be used when there are no problems with leaving access to unidentified sub-paths open.

### Partial Allow + Partial Deny

When access to unidentified sub-paths should not be allowed, you must clearly specify the paths to allow.

1. Register all paths that need access permission in Path Management and assign appropriate Path Tags.
2. When configuring policies, use conditions such as tags, user attributes, and IP. 
    1. Even if you specify the urlPaths of the controlled web app as all, when tag conditions are applied, policies are set only for paths registered in Path Management.
    2. If necessary, you can specify the scope of users to allow web app access using user attributes or IP.

<Callout type="important">
**Warning**

When using partial allow patterns, **landing pages that are absolutely necessary for normal website use** must be configured as separate policies and included in roles.

* Example: Login pages, redirect pages, etc.
