# Alerts

### Overview

The Alerts page provides notification functionality related to resource access. By pre-setting trigger conditions for major anomalies, you can detect policy violations in real-time. This allows for rapid identification and resolution of potential security incidents, and protection of sensitive information such as queries or data leaks that exceed predefined thresholds.

<Callout type="info">
From version 11.1.0, when the New DAC Policy Management feature is activated, you can use the following alert types:
* New Request - DB Policy Exception Request<br/>DB Policy Exception Request has two types: Unmasking and Restricted Data Access, but they cannot be distinguished for alert generation.
* Data Access
    * Column Data Masking : Event where data was queried in a restricted masked state due to Column Data Masking policy created in new policy management
    * Table Access Restriction : Event where access to specific tables was restricted due to Table Access Restriction policy created in new policy management
    * Column Access Restriction : Event where access to specific columns was restricted due to Column Access Restriction policy created in new policy management
    * Sensitive Data Access Monitoring : Event that meets the conditions of Sensitive Data Access Monitoring policy created in new policy management

**10.2.8 Slack Message Template Changes**

* Sensitive Data Access events have been improved to include queries in Slack messages, and the `{{queryPreview}}` variable has been added. Due to Slack's characteristics, sending messages over 3000 characters will fail without returning an error, so queries visible through queryPreview are limited to 100 characters.
