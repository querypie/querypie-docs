## Overview

The Channels page allows you to register and manage channels to receive notifications sent by QueryPie. Currently, QueryPie provides four channel types: Slack, Agit, HTTP, and Email, and preliminary work for integration is required before channel registration.

## Viewing Registered Channels

You can view the list of currently registered channels in the Administrator &gt; General &gt; Company Management &gt; Channels page. You can search by channel name and filter by Channel Type.
