## Overview

Workflow is a feature that supports requesting approval for various tasks that must be performed under the approval of authorized personnel within QueryPie, and processing from approval to actual task execution. Workflow Management is a feature for managing Workflows from the administrator side, where you can manage the entire request list and approval rules (Approval Rule). You can also set up approval for the entire Workflow.


* [All Requests](workflow-management/all-requests) : View all request lists submitted through Workflow and check detailed information.
* [Approval Rules](workflow-management/approval-rules) : Manage approval rules.
* [Workflow Configurations](workflow-management/workflow-configurations) : Set up approval submission and approval processes.
