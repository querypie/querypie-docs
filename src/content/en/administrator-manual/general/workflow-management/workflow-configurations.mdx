## Activating Reviewer Assignment

Activate with the "Activate Review Step to collaborate with others" toggle.

* Determines whether to allow specifying reviewers when submitting Workflow requests. 
* When the toggle is on, the reviewer assignment button is displayed in the **Approval Rules** section of the request creation screen.
* When the toggle is off, the button is removed. (Previously assigned records are maintained and can still be viewed in the list.)

## Allowing Post-Approval

Activate with the "Allow users to submit requests in Urgent mode" toggle.

* Determines whether to allow post-approval mode (Urgent Mode) when submitting Workflow requests.
* When the toggle is on, post-approval related toggles are displayed in the following areas.
    * Approval Rules : Creating and modifying approval rules
    * Submit Request : Approval rules section in the request creation screen
* When the toggle is off, post-approval related toggles are no longer displayed in the above areas. However, previously submitted requests in post-approval mode remain and can be executed.

## Activating Throttling for SQL Request Execution (Use throttling when submitting SQL Request in Workflow)

When the toggle is on, throttling is applied when executing SQL requests submitted in Workflow.

When this option is activated, queries are executed continuously up to the specified number, then wait for the specified interval (ms). This prevents DB load from large query execution.

*  **Maximum concurrent queries**  : Maximum number of queries that can be executed continuously (1 ~ 999,999)
*  **Query throttle interval** : Interval between continuous query executions (1 ~ 9,999 ms)

## Filtering by Tag in Workflow Forms (Tag Display and Filtering in DAC Workflow Requests)

Activate with the "Tag Display and Filtering in DAC Workflow Requests" toggle switch.

When this option is activated, you can filter targets by tag in the following request forms.

* DB Access Request : You can view tags assigned to DB Connections in the list and filter to show only connections with specific tags through filters.
