# Approval Rules

### Overview

Approval Rules refer to the Workflow approval processes preset by administrators. Approval rules are created for each request type, allowing you to set approval stages from 1 to 4 levels and configure assignee selection methods for each stage. The Approval Rules page provides the following functions:

1. **Approval Rules List View**: You can view the list of registered approval rules. (Recent creation order)
2. **Approval Settings**: Configure approval submission and approval processes.
    1. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Workflow Configurations](workflow-configurations) document.
3. **Approval Rule Creation**: Click the `Add Approval Rule` button in the top right of the page.
4. **Detail Information Check and Edit**: Click on an approval rule in the list to check and edit registered content.
5. **Approval Rule Deletion**: Select checkboxes in the list to display the `Delete` button in the table header, which can be clicked to delete registered rules.

This document guides you through creating, viewing, modifying, and deleting approval rules.
