## Overview

QueryPie provides group functionality that allows you to bundle users into groups for collective management. Groups can be used as units for granting DB access permissions, Workflow approval/reviewer roles, and server or Kubernetes role assignments. The Groups page allows you to view and manage user group lists registered in QueryPie.

## Viewing Group List

Navigate to the Administrator > General > User Management > Groups page to view the group list. You can search by group name. The following information is available for viewing:
