# Groups

### Overview

QueryPie provides a group feature that allows users to be grouped and managed in bulk. Groups can be used as units for DB access permissions, Workflow approval/reviewer roles, and server or Kubernetes role assignments. The Groups page allows you to view and manage the list of user groups registered in QueryPie.


### Viewing Group List

When you enter the Administrator > General > User Management > Groups page, you can view the group list. You can search by group name. The viewable information is as follows:
