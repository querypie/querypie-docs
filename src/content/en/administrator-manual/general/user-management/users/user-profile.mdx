# User Profile

### Overview

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) can be implemented with attributes registered in the user profile. This document provides detailed information for each user detail information item.

### Profile 

This is a tab where you can view the user's Attributes. Please refer to the **Reference: User Attribute List** item at the bottom of this page for descriptions of each Attribute.

<Callout type="important">
**Prerequisites**
To assign Allowed Zones per user, you must first activate the user-specific QueryPie Web access IP control functionality in Admin &gt; General &gt; Company Management &gt; Security menu. Please refer to the [Security](../../company-management/security) documentation.
</Callout>

#### Checking Static IPs Registered Through Workflow

When users request IP address registration through the 'IP Registration Request' workflow and receive final approval, that IP is automatically added to the `Static IP` attribute in the user's **Profile** tab.

These addresses registered in the `Static IP` attribute are automatically reflected in this `Allowed Zone` tab as items with `Name` as `Static IP`, and users are granted access permissions from those IPs.

</figure>

#### Deleting Static IPs Registered Through Workflow

`Static IP` items automatically registered through workflow cannot be directly `Detach`ed from the `Allowed Zones` tab. To delete them, you must go to the user's **Profile** tab and directly edit the `Static IP` attribute value to remove the desired IP address. When values are deleted from the `Static IP` attribute, those IPs are immediately removed from the `Allowed Zones` tab and access permissions are revoked.

#### Table Display Information

The information displayed in the table is as follows.

1.  **Name** : Allowed Zone name
2.  **IP Bands**  : Allowed Zone IP range

#### Assigning Allowed Zones to Users

Click the `Attach Allowed Zones` button on the right side of the Allowed Zones tab to display the Allowed Zone assignment modal. Select the Allowed Zone you want to assign and click the `Attach` button to complete the assignment.
