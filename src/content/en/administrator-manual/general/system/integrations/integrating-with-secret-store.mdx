## Overview

In the Integrations menu, you can enter and manage Secret Store information.

Through Secret Store, you can securely manage DB and server authentication information, and safely connect to DB and servers without directly exposing authentication information to users. When storing connection information, you can configure it to authenticate by retrieving authentication information from Secret Store rather than storing it within QueryPie.

The actual use of [Secret Store](../../company-management/security) can be configured in the Security menu. The following is a list of Secret Store services currently supported by QueryPie.

* HashiCorp Vault
* Microsoft Active Directory

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisites for Vault Integration:**

1.  **Vault Server for QueryPie Integration:** 
    * To integrate with Vault, the Vault server must be running. The Vault service must be running, able to process API requests, and perform authentication in Vault.
2.  **Authentication Information for Resources Stored in Vault:** 
    * To integrate with Vault, authentication information for services (e.g., DB, Server, etc.) that will connect to Vault must be pre-stored. This means having access permissions and authentication information (e.g., Username, Password, API keys, etc.) for the services to be integrated stored in Vault.
3.  **Correct Path for Retrieving Authentication Information:** 
    * The path used to identify credentials stored in Vault must be accurate. This refers to the path that specifies which credentials to retrieve from Vault. This path is connected to resources and credentials stored in Vault.

* For more detailed Vault configuration, please refer to the [Hashicorp Vault Documentation official documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).

<Callout type="important">
To actually store authentication information in Secret Store from QueryPie, you must enable Secret Store usage in the Security page after completing Vault integration. For detailed information, please refer to the Security l Secret Store configuration documentation.
