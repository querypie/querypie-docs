## Overview

This is a page for managing External API tokens.


## What is External API?

External API is an API that allows you to use QueryPie's features outside of the web console. Currently in version 10.0, it provides two versions: V0.9 and V2.

*  **QueryPie API V2** 
    * QueryPie version 9.16.1 and later supports V2 API.
    * The call path is `{querypie url}/api/external/v2/` and can be used without affecting the existing API V0.9.
* The basic headers required for API calls are as follows. Please refer to the API documentation for detailed API specifications.

|  **Key**      |  **Value**             |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Content-Type  | application/json       |
| Authorization | `{querypie api token}` |

Precautions when using API tokens are as follows.

* API tokens can be issued by users with Owner privileges or administrators with access to the corresponding menu.
* Tokens are fully exposed only upon initial issuance. After that, all except the first 8 characters are masked and displayed.
    *  **If the token key is lost** , we recommend deleting the existing key from the history and issuing a new token to use.
* When extending API tokens, the expiration date is extended by the period set when the token was created from the time the Update button is pressed.
