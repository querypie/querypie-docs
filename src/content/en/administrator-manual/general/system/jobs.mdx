### Viewing Jobs List

You can check the Jobs list page by navigating to Administrator &gt; General &gt; System &gt; Jobs menu.

Job types are broadly divided into two categories.

1. System jobs automatically created with QueryPie settings

    * Executed at predetermined intervals by scheduling.
    * Additional manual execution is not possible.
2. Resource synchronization jobs created according to user resource creation
    * Includes DB Cloud Provider, Server Cloud Provider, Kubernetes Cluster Sync, Authentication.
    * Separate jobs are created for each resource, and job names are displayed the same as resource names.
    * Replication Frequency is specified as configured when creating resources. (Scheduling or Manual)
        * Even when job type is Scheduling, additional manual job execution is possible. In this case, manual execution can be started from each resource management page, and only job status tracking is possible from the Jobs page.

Information displayed for each job is as follows.
