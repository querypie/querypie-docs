# Maintenance

### Overview

When upgrading QueryPie, the Log DB can be large and difficult to back up, and key features should not stop recording even during the upgrade. To control the service level appropriately, enable maintenance mode and perform migration.

If QueryPie servers are deployed in an active-active pair, follow the steps below:

1.  **Preparation**: Download the latest package and review configuration files.
2.  **Enable maintenance mode**: Announce the work and limit service access levels.
3.  **Prepare the database**: Create schemas for the new version and replicate existing data.
4.  **Upgrade server B**: Remove server B from the load balancer (LB), migrate, and install the new version.
5.  **Test server B**: Connect directly to server B and verify the upgrade.
6.  **Upgrade server A**: Reconnect server B to the LB, detach server A, then install the new version on server A.
7.  **Final switch**: Reconnect server A to the LB and complete the overall upgrade.
