### Installing OAuth-supported Apps
For MCP servers that support OAuth authentication like Google and Atlassian, clicking the Connect & Install button will redirect you to the login/authentication page of the corresponding application.

After authentication, the MCP server installation is completed.

### Installing API Key-supported Apps
For MCP servers that don't support OAuth authentication like AWS MCP, you need to obtain and enter API Keys such as Access Key and Secret Key. All API Key information is stored encrypted.<br />
Clicking the **Install** button completes the integration with the entered API Key.

## Creating MCP Presets

**MCP Preset** is a template that configures AI to operate in a specific context.

Go to the **MCP Presets** tab and click the **Create New Preset** button. (If you're creating a preset for the first time, you'll automatically enter the preset creation page.)

1. Enter basic preset information.
   - **MCP Preset Name**: A name to distinguish the preset.
   - **Instruction**: Instructions that are basically included when chatting using the preset. It can include the preset's role, context, response style, etc.
2. In **MCP Servers & Tools**, select the tools of MCP servers to include in this preset.
3. Click the **Save Changes** button to save.

## Chatting in AI Hub

Now all settings are complete. Start chatting with AI using MCP Presets!

1. Go to the **Chat** tab.
2. Type `@` and select the MCP Preset you just created from the context menu.
3. Enter questions or requests in the chat box. For example, if you've integrated Slack MCP, the following requests are possible:
   ```
   "Please send a message saying 'test' to the helloworld channel."
   ```
4. AI processes requests in real-time through the configured Integration.
