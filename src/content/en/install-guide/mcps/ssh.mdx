# SSH

Connect to remote servers via SSH protocol to execute commands and retrieve results.

## Key Features
- Remote server command execution
- Real-time command output retrieval
- Secure SSH connections
- Support for various authentication methods

## Basic Information

### Authentication Method
Authenticate using SSH keys or passwords.

### Input Parameters
- **Host** (required): SSH server host address
- **Port** (required): SSH server port (default: 22)
- **Username** (required): SSH username
- **Password** (optional): SSH password
- **Private Key** (optional): SSH private key
- **Passphrase** (optional): Passphrase for decrypting encrypted SSH private key

## Supported MCP Tools

### Command Execution Tools
#### execute_command
Execute shell commands on remote SSH server and return output.

**Input Parameters:**
- `command` (required): Shell command to execute

**Supported Command Examples:**
- System information: `uname -a`, `whoami`, `pwd`
- File system operations: `ls -la`, `cat filename`, `find /path -name "*.txt"`
- Process management: `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`
- Network diagnostics: `ping hostname`, `netstat -an`, `ss -tuln`
- System monitoring: `df -h`, `free -m`, `uptime`
- Log viewing: `tail -f /var/log/syslog`, `journalctl -f`

## Usage Example

For example,
- When you input the prompt "Check the disk usage of the remote server",
- The LLM will call the `execute_command` tool through MCP to execute the `df -h` command.
- Then, it responds in the chat based on the tool call results.

## Precautions
- Keep SSH authentication information secure.
- Use read-only commands on production servers.
- Carefully review system-changing commands before execution.
- Check network connection status.
- Appropriately limit command execution permissions.
