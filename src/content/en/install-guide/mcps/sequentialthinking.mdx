# Sequential Thinking

A sequential thinking tool for analyzing and solving complex problems step by step. It enables deep analysis through dynamic and reflective problem-solving processes.

## Key Features
- Step-by-step problem analysis and resolution
- Dynamic thinking process adjustment
- Review and revision of previous steps
- Hypothesis generation and verification
- Multi-approach exploration
- Uncertainty expression and alternative exploration

## Use Cases
Sequential Thinking MCP can be utilized in the following scenarios:
- Breaking down complex problems step by step
- Considering modification possibilities in planning and design processes
- Analysis requiring direction changes during the process
- Problems where the overall scope is not clear initially
- Tasks requiring multi-step solutions
- Situations requiring context maintenance across multiple steps
- Situations requiring filtering of irrelevant information

## Basic Information

### Authentication Method
No separate authentication is required.

### Input Parameters
No parameters need to be configured.

## Supported MCP Tools

### sequentialthinking
A tool for analyzing and solving complex problems step by step.

**Input Parameters:**
- `thought` (required): Content of the current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (required): Whether additional thinking is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (required): Current thinking step number
- `totalThoughts` (required): Expected total number of thinking steps
- `isRevision` (optional): Whether revising a previous thought
- `revisesThought` (optional): Thought step number being revised
- `branchFromThought` (optional): Thought step number to branch from
- `branchId` (optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (optional): Whether more thoughts are needed

## Usage Example

For example,
- When you input "Analyze a complex business problem step by step" as a prompt,
- The LLM calls the `sequentialthinking` tool multiple times through MCP to systematically analyze the problem.
- At each call step, it develops thinking, reviews previous steps when necessary, and derives the final solution.
- Then, it responds in the chat based on the tool call results.
