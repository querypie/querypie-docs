# Kakao Navigation

Use navigation features such as route guidance, pathfinding, and waypoint setting through the Kakao Navigation API.

## Key Features
- Route guidance from origin to destination
- Route planning with waypoints
- Multi-origin route calculation
- Multi-destination route calculation
- Future time-based route calculation

## Basic Information

### Authentication Method
Authenticate using API Key.

### Input Parameters
- **API Key** (required): REST API key issued from Kakao Developers Center

## Supported MCP Tools

### Route Guidance Tools
#### navigation_directions
Calculate routes from origin to destination.

**Input Parameters:**
- `origin` (required): Origin coordinates (longitude,latitude)
- `destination` (required): Destination coordinates (longitude,latitude)
- `priority` (optional): Route priority (RECOMMEND, TIME, DISTANCE)
- `car_fuel` (optional): Vehicle fuel type
- `car_hipass` (optional): Whether to use Hi-pass
- `alternatives` (optional): Whether to provide alternative routes
- `road_details` (optional): Whether to provide detailed road information

#### navigation_waypoints
Calculate routes including waypoints.

**Input Parameters:**
- `origin` (required): Origin coordinates
- `destination` (required): Destination coordinates
- `waypoints` (required): List of waypoint coordinates
- `priority` (optional): Route priority
- `car_fuel` (optional): Vehicle fuel type
- `car_hipass` (optional): Whether to use Hi-pass

#### navigation_origins
Calculate routes from multiple origins to one destination.

**Input Parameters:**
- `origins` (required): List of origin coordinates
- `destination` (required): Destination coordinates
- `priority` (optional): Route priority
- `car_fuel` (optional): Vehicle fuel type
- `car_hipass` (optional): Whether to use Hi-pass

#### navigation_destinations
Calculate routes from one origin to multiple destinations.

**Input Parameters:**
- `origin` (required): Origin coordinates
- `destinations` (required): List of destination coordinates
- `priority` (optional): Route priority
- `car_fuel` (optional): Vehicle fuel type
- `car_hipass` (optional): Whether to use Hi-pass

#### navigation_future
Calculate routes based on future time.

**Input Parameters:**
- `origin` (required): Origin coordinates
- `destination` (required): Destination coordinates
- `departure_time` (required): Departure time
- `priority` (optional): Route priority
- `car_fuel` (optional): Vehicle fuel type
- `car_hipass` (optional): Whether to use Hi-pass

## Usage Example
The Kakao Navigation MCP server should be used together with the Kakao Map MCP server. <br/>
To find routes from origin to destination, first convert place queries to coordinates and use them to calculate routes.

For example,
- When you input the prompt "Tell me the route from Gangnam Station to Hongik University Station",
- The LLM first calls the `map_address_to_coord` tool from the Kakao Map MCP server to get coordinates for Gangnam Station and Hongik University Station.
- Then the LLM calls the `navigation_directions` tool from the Kakao Navigation MCP server to calculate the route.
- Finally, it responds in the chat based on the tool call results.

## API Key Setup Method
1. Register an application in Kakao Developers Center.
2. Get a REST API key.
3. Select Kakao Navigation integration in QueryPie AI.
4. Complete the connection by entering the issued API key.

## Precautions
- Keep your generated API Key secure.
- Check daily call limits and use appropriately.
- Coordinates use the WGS84 coordinate system.
- Provides routes that reflect real-time traffic information.
