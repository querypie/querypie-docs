## Supported MCP Tools

### execute_sql
Execute SQL queries on Snowflake database and return results.

**In read-only mode**, only the following SQL commands are allowed:
- `SELECT` - Data retrieval
- `WITH` - Common Table Expression (CTE) usage
- `EXPLAIN` - Query execution plan retrieval
- `ANALYZE` - Query analysis
- `SHOW` - Metadata retrieval

**Result Limit**: For performance reasons, returns a maximum of 500 rows.

For example,
- When you input the prompt "Query the user table data",
- The LLM executes the `SELECT * FROM users` query through MCP.
- Then, it responds in the chat based on the tool call results.

## Snowflake Connection Setup Method
1. Prepare a user account with access to the Snowflake account.
2. Grant necessary database permissions.
3. Set warehouse access permissions.
4. Select Snowflake integration in QueryPie AI.
5. Complete the setup by entering the account identifier and connection information.

## Precautions
- Keep your Snowflake user account password secure.
- It's recommended to grant only the minimum necessary database permissions.
- Choose an appropriate warehouse size as costs are incurred based on warehouse size.
- Large query results are limited to 500 rows, so use appropriate LIMIT clauses.
- You can enable read-only mode to prevent data changes.
- Using HTTPS protocol is recommended.
