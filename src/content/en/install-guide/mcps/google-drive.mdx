## Usage Example

For example,
- When you input "Retrieve the file list from My Drive" as a prompt,
- The LLM calls the `roots` and `folder_children` tools through MCP to retrieve the file list.
- Then, it responds in the chat based on the tool call results.

## Notes
- Be careful when processing large volumes of files in batch operations.
- File deletion is recoverable, but permanent deletion is irreversible, so use it carefully.
- File locking feature is only available for Google Workspace accounts.
