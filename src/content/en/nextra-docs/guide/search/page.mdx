# Search Engine

Nextra features full-page search, that includes list items, code blocks,
headings and table cells.

Nextra indexes your content automatically at build-time and performs incredibly
fast full-text search via
[FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch).

## Configuration

### `nextraConfig.search`

- Type: `boolean | { codeblocks: boolean }`
- Default: `true`

## Example

```js filename="next.config.mjs" {4-6}
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  search: {
    codeblocks: false
  }
})
```

## Search in code blocks

Inline `<code attr="foo" />{:html}` can be searched as well as code blocks.

```html
<code>I'm Searchable!</code>
```

> [!TIP]
>
> To disable search in code blocks set `search: { codeblocks: false }{:js}`
