title: 'Requesting DB Policy Exception Request'

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Overview

When using the new DAC policy supported from version 10.2.6, you cannot request through Workflow using the existing Unmasking Request or Restricted Data Access Request. That is, when the new policy feature is activated, use the DB Policy Exception Request displayed in the Request menu.<br/>Unlike existing policies, DB Policy Exception Request does not separate Unmasking and Restricted Data Access into separate forms, but rather selects one of Unmasking or Restricted Data Access as the Exception Type in a single form.

## Requesting Policy Exception

### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Exception Expiration End Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.

### 5. Entering Request Details

* **Title**: Enter the request title.
* **Exception Type**: Select Unmasking for temporary mask removal requests, and Restricted Data Access for temporary access requests to blocked paths.
* **Connection**: Select the connection that contains the table or column for which you want to request mask permission or access permission.<br/>For mask removal, only columns can be selected since masking policies are column-based.
* **Data Scope**: You can select either Data Path or Tag. The default value is "Data Path".
    * **Data Path**: Directly specify the column or table you want to unmask or access.
        * **Table**: Select the target table.
        * **Column**: You can select one or more columns, up to a maximum of 30 columns.
    * **Tag**: If the applicant knows that a policy is set based on tags for a specific path and knows which tags are assigned, they can apply by specifying tags. Generally, since applicants do not know whether policies are set with tags or which tags are used, they need to get help from administrators first when applying with tags.
        * **Tags**: When Data scope is specified as tags, you can use the tags used in the policy.
* **Data Access Expiration**: You can set the period for which you want to request data access permission.
    1. When selecting Time Duration, you can input in minutes, with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 44,640 minutes.
