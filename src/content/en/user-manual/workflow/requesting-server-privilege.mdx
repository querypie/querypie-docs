# Requesting Server Privilege Request

### Overview

Using Server Privilege Request, you can easily request temporary command usage permissions for servers. You can select and apply for the temporary command usage time and the start time of permissions (immediately upon approval or from server access time). This feature only supports SSH protocol communication.

### Server Privilege Request

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Privilege Expiration Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted. If Maximum Approval Duration &gt; Maximum Access Duration, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is applied the same as the value of Maximum Access Duration. Example) If Maximum Approval Duration is 14 days and Maximum Access Duration is 5 days, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is also applied as 5 days.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.

#### 7. Entering Commands to Use

* The command input method varies depending on the administrator's settings.

    * Enter the commands you want to apply for temporary use in **Commands**.
        * **Keyword**: You can enter commands as keywords.
        * **RegEx**: You can enter commands in regular expression format.<br/>

* When selecting Command Template
    * If the administrator has enabled the Allow Pre-defined Command Templates Only option, a Command Template selection box appears instead of directly entering Commands.
        1. Select a template containing the permissions you want to use from the dropdown list.
        2. When you select a template, the included commands (Keyword, RegEx) are displayed on the screen, but you cannot modify them directly.<br/>

<Callout type="info">
**Q. It says there are no templates to select.**
A. This is the case when there are no templates that the administrator has allowed to be used in workflow. You need to request the administrator to check the settings.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**When the request includes only non-Linux servers**
If the request target consists only of non-Linux servers such as Windows servers, this request is intended to obtain temporary access permissions to the server rather than specific command usage. Therefore, the field for entering or selecting Commands is not displayed on the screen.
