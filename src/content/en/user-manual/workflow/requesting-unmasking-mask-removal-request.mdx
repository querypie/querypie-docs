# Requesting Unmasking (Mask Removal Request)

### Overview

When you need to verify original data for items masked by masking policies in DAC, you can request temporary mask removal from administrators through Workflow. Mask removal can be requested through Workflow, or through the Unmasking Request menu that appears when you right-click on masked data in the web SQL editor.

### Requesting Unmasking

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Unmasking Expiration End Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.
