</Callout>

#### 3. Processing Delegated Proxy Approval Requests

* During the proxy approval setting period, the requests that the proxy approver can check are as follows:
    * **Received Requests &gt; To Do**: List of unprocessed requests received by the original approver (including requests received before the setting period)
    * **Received Requests &gt; Done**: You can view requests processed by the proxy approver within the proxy approval setting period.
* You can approve or reject on the detail page, and when entering comments, a message indicating that you are in proxy approval is displayed.

#### 4. Checking Requests Processed by Proxy Approval

If you are using request notifications through Slack DM, Workflow step-by-step notifications are also sent to the proxy approver. For detailed information about Slack DM notifications, please refer to the [Using Slack DM Personal Notifications](../../administrator-manual/general/system/integrations/integrating-with-slack-dm/slack-dm-workflow-notification-types) document.
</Callout>

#### 5. How to View Drafts After Proxy Approval Setting Ends

* Even after the proxy approval setting period ends, you can check requests processed by the proxy approver within the proxy approval setting period in the Received Requests &gt; Done list. Other requests can no longer be viewed or processed.

### Resubmitting Existing Requests

You can resubmit approval requests with the same content repeatedly or for rejected approval items as follows:
