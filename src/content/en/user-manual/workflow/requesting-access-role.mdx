## Overview

Access Role Request allows you to easily request roles for servers or Kubernetes clusters that need access. Roles are granted immediately upon approval, and you can access servers or Kubernetes clusters allowed by the role.

## Access Role Request

### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Role Expiration Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.

Access Role Request can only request one role at a time. Since separate approval requests are required for each role, permission management can be strengthened.
</Callout>
