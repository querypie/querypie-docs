# Requesting DB Access Request

### Overview

You can request Privilege for DB connections that need access by following the steps below. After approval is completed, permissions are immediately granted, and you can access the granted connections through the SQL Editor in QueryPie Web or through Agent.

### Requesting DB Access Request

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Access Expiration Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted. If Maximum Approval Duration &gt; Maximum Access Duration, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is applied the same as the value of Maximum Access Duration. Example) If Maximum Approval Duration is 14 days and Maximum Access Duration is 5 days, the value of Maximum Approval Duration is also applied as 5 days.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.
