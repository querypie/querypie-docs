# Requesting Restricted Data Access

### Overview

When you need access to tables or columns restricted by "Data Access" policies in DAC, you can request temporary access permission from administrators through Workflow. Requests can be made through Workflow, or through the Send Restricted Data Access Request menu that appears when you right-click on the result window in the web SQL editor.

### Requesting Restricted Data Access Request

#### 1. Selecting Approval Rules

* Select an Approval Rule to choose the appropriate approval rule for your purpose. The approval target varies depending on the selected rule.
* If a pre-configured approval rule is selected, the approver is automatically assigned and cannot be added or modified.
* **Approval Expiration Date**: Enter the approval expiration date. The maximum value can be set through Maximum Approval Duration. The Approval Expiration Date cannot exceed the Data Access Expiration End Date. If exceeded, the request cannot be submitted.
    * However, when submitting in Urgent Mode, the above condition is ignored.
