import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Overview

Connection through URL Proxy without an agent is also supported. When you want to connect to a DB from web services like Redash, Tableau, Zeppelin, you can safely access the database while applying access control policies through the URL Proxy authentication information generated by QueryPie.

## Receiving URL Proxy Authentication Information

<Callout type="info">
This operation is only possible for DB connections where Proxy use has been enabled by administrators. For setup instructions, please refer to the [Enable Database Proxy](../../querypie-overview/proxy-management/enable-database-proxy) document.
* From version 10.2.6, Service Name/SID information is displayed in the Proxy Info of Oracle user connection pages.
</Callout>
