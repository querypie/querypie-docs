## Overview

Users who have been granted access permissions for connections can access database connections through the Web SQL Editor or proxy in a controlled environment. Access permissions can be granted to individual users or user groups.

You can access database connections and execute queries to retrieve data through the following methods:

* [Connecting with Web SQL Editor](database-access-control/connecting-with-web-sql-editor)
* [Connecting to Proxy without Agent](database-access-control/connecting-to-proxy-without-agent)
* [Connecting to Proxy through Agent](user-agent)

**Differences between Web SQL Editor and Proxy Connection Methods**

QueryPie provides a **Web SQL Editor** that allows you to execute queries and retrieve data through a web browser. This web environment has a high level of security control, with minimal permissions for data export/import and clipboard copying, while allowing developers or personnel who need data retrieval and processing to perform database-related tasks more easily and efficiently in a web environment with access control applied. For production environments that contain personal information or provide services to customers, it is recommended to access databases and execute queries in the web environment.

On the other hand, **proxy connection through agents** allows developers or data personnel to use **existing DB connection tools** as they are. The agent installed on the user's desktop acts as a proxy connection between the database and client, enabling developers to continue using their existing DB client tools. This allows developers to perform SQL tasks more conveniently using familiar tools, but there are **difficulties in controlling detailed features** provided by client tools.

**Connection through URL Proxy without Agent** is also supported. When you want to connect to a DB from **web services such as Redash, Tableau, and Zeppelin**, you can safely access the database while applying access control policies through URL Proxy authentication information generated by QueryPie.

In summary, since the Web SQL Editor and proxy methods each have their own advantages and limitations, it is important to choose and use the appropriate method according to the situation, considering the security control level of the database and user convenience.
