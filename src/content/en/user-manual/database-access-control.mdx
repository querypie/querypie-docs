## Overview

Users who have been granted access permissions for a connection can connect to database connections in a controlled environment via the Web SQL Editor or a proxy. Permissions may be granted to individual users or to user groups.

You can connect to a database and run queries to browse data using the following methods:

* [Connect with Web SQL Editor](database-access-control/connecting-with-web-sql-editor)
* [Connect to Proxy without Agent](database-access-control/connecting-to-proxy-without-agent)
* [Connect to Proxy via Agent](user-agent)

**Differences between Web SQL Editor and Proxy access**

QueryPie provides a **Web SQL Editor** that lets you run queries and browse data from your web browser. This environment enforces a high level of security controls. While export/import and clipboard copy are tightly restricted to the minimum necessary, developers and data users can still work efficiently within a secured, access‑controlled web environment. For databases that contain personal data or serve production workloads, we recommend connecting and running queries in the web environment.

By contrast, **proxy access via the Agent** lets developers or data users continue using their **existing DB client tools**. The desktop agent acts as a proxy between the database and the client, allowing developers to keep using familiar tools. This is convenient for SQL work; however, note that it is **harder to control the fine‑grained features provided by each client tool**.

QueryPie also supports **URL Proxy access without an Agent**. When a **web service (e.g., Redash, Tableau, Zeppelin)** needs to connect to a DB, you can use QueryPie‑issued URL Proxy credentials to apply access control policies and connect safely.

In short, each approach has advantages and trade‑offs. Choose the method that best fits your security requirements and user convenience.
