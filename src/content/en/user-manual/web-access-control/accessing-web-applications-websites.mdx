## Overview

Users can check the list of web applications (websites) for which they have been granted access permissions and safely work by accessing each web application or SaaS platform. To access, you must first have a Role with access permissions granted to you. You need to select an appropriate Role or apply for web application access permissions through Workflow if you don't have a Role.
