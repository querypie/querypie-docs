<Callout type="info">
Multiple connections when using FileZilla
* FileZilla accelerates operations by using multiple connections for uploads/downloads. As a result, multiple connections may appear in Session Monitoring depending on the number of files or tasks.
* Also, even after downloads or uploads complete, connections may persist for a certain period based on FileZilla's persistent connection settings and may not close immediately.
