> - If Google OTP is the second factor
>   - Enter your sign‑in password on the sign‑in page.
>   - On your first sign‑in, register QueryPie in your Authenticator app by scanning the QR code shown in the popup. The page suggests downloading an authentication app such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Okta Verify, making it easy to install a compatible app from the App Store or Google Play.
>   - Enter the one‑time verification code from your Authenticator app.
> - If Email is the second factor
>   - Enter your sign‑in password on the sign‑in page.
>   - Check your email inbox for the authentication code. The code is valid for 30 minutes.
>   - You can request “Resend authentication code.” A second resend request is available after 5 minutes.
