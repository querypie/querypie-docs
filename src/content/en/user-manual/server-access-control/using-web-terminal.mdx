* If the administrator has set the maximum number of sessions for the server to 1 or more, you can open multiple sessions by clicking the `+` button in the top toolbar.
* Select the account and protocol to connect to as when first connecting to the server, then click the `Open` button.

### Session Expiration Alert

To prevent web terminal sessions from unexpectedly terminating during long-running commands or tasks, browser notifications are provided 5 minutes before session expiration. This notification applies to Stale Timeout (session expiration after a certain period of inactivity).

To receive notifications properly, you must set the notification (Notifications) permission of the web browser you are using to 'Allow'. The session timeout time is applied based on the shortest time among various policies set by the administrator (Server Session Timeout, Server Default Settings, Policy).
