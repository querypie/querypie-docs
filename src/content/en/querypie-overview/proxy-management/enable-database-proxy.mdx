# Enable Database Proxy Usage

### Overview

Proxy connection is supported when accessing database connections. By default, you can access connections through the web SQL editor provided by QueryPie, and you can access connections from tools using existing DB username/password through Proxy Credential information generated by QueryPie or through Agent. By supporting Proxy connections along with the web SQL editor, you can control connection access and apply policies without problems in various user environments, and logs can be recorded. Currently, Proxy connections support MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Trino, SQLServer, and MongoDB.


### Enable Proxy Usage Option

By default, the Proxy usage option is disabled. Enable the Proxy usage option for connections that allow access.

1. Navigate to the DB Connections menu in the Database settings menu.
2. Click on one of the registered connections.
3. Move to the Additional Information section at the bottom.
4. Check the `Proxy Usage` option to enable it.
5. Select one of two Proxy authentication methods.
    1.  **Use QueryPie registered account** : This method generates Proxy access information based on the DB username/password stored by the administrator in the connection information page. Users can access Proxy using Agent or separately generated Proxy Credential information.
    2.  **Use existing database account with Agent**  : This method generates Proxy access information that allows users to use their existing DB username/password. Users can access Proxy using localhost and port information after running Agent.â€» When using user DB username/password authentication, access is only possible through Agent.
6.  **Network ID**  : This is a required setting value when using the Reverse SSH feature.

When the Proxy Usage option is enabled, a Port for Proxy access is assigned to that connection. Users can check Proxy access information when this option is enabled, and only administrators can configure this Proxy option.


### Check Connections with Proxy Usage Enabled
